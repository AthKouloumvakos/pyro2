There are 4 different solvers that we can run: advection,
compressible, incompressible, and multigrid.

These are run directly from the respective directory.  Beneath each
solver directory is a problems/ directory which contains the
initialization routines for different problems and a test/ directory
which stores known output for comparison purposes.

 
Each routine should have its own built in unit test accessible by
simply running the python file directly (i.e. not importing it).
