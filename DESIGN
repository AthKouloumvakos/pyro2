-- All top-level code is python

-- some numerically intense low level functions (e.g. slope
   reconstruction) are in F90, coded with f2py

   o F90 routines need to standalone -- they cannot have
     any dependencies from other files

   o used only in cases where numpy array notation would result in
     code that is harded to understand at a glance
