<P><H2>&lowast; Incompressible</H2>

<p>pyro's incompressible solver combines the Godunov/advection features
used in the advection and compressible solver together with multigrid
to enforce the divergence constraint on the velocities.  Chapter 9 of the
notes describe the basic algorithm:

<div class="pdf"><a href="../CompHydroTutorial.pdf">notes on computational hydro</a></div>

<p>Here we implement a cell-centered approximate projection method for
solving the incompressible equations.  At the moment, only periodic
BCs are supported.

<p><h2>&lowast; Examples</h2>

<p><h3>shear</h3>

<p>The shear problem initializes a shear layer in a domain with
doubly-periodic boundaries and looks at the development of two
vortices as the shear layer rolls up.  This problem was explored in a
number of papers, for example, Bell, Colella, &amp; Glaz (1989) and
Martin &amp; Colella (2000).  This is run as:

<pre class="code">./pyro incompressible shear inputs.shear</pre>

<p class="center"><img src="examples/shear.png">

<p>The vorticity panel (lower left) is what is usually shown in
papers.  Note that the velocity divergence is not zero&mdash;this is
because we are using an <em>approximate</em> projection.


<p><h3>convergence</h3>

<p>The convergence test initialize a simple velocity field on a periodic
unit square with known analytic solution.  By evolving at a variety of
resolutions and comparing to the analytic solution, we can measure the
convergence rate of the algorithm.  The particular set of initial
conditions is from Minion (1996).  Limiting can be disabled by
adding <tt>incompressible.limiter=0</tt> to the run command.  The
basic set of tests shown below are run as:

<pre class="code">
./pyro.py incompressible converge inputs.converge.32 vis.dovis=0
./pyro.py incompressible converge inputs.converge.64 vis.dovis=0
./pyro.py incompressible converge inputs.converge.128 vis.dovis=0</pre>

<p>The error is measured by comparing with the analytic solution using the routine <tt>incomp_converge_error.py</tt> in <tt>analysis/</tt>.

<p class="center"><img src="examples/incomp_converge.png">

<p>The dashed line is second order convergence.  We see almost second
order behavior with the limiters enabled and slightly better than
second order with no limiting.


<p><h2>&lowast; Exercises</h2>

<p><h3>Explorations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Disable the MAC projection and run the converge problem&mdash;is
  the method still 2nd order?</li>

<li>Disable all projections&mdash;does the solution still even try to
  preserve &nabla; &middot; U = 0?</li>

<li>Experiment with what is projected.  Try projecting U<sub>t</sub>
     to see if that makes a difference.</li>

</ul>

<p><h3>Extensions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Switch the final projection from a cell-centered approximate projection
    to a nodal projection.  This will require writing a new multigrid solver
    that operates on nodal data.</li>

<li>Add viscosity to the system.  This will require doing 2 parabolic solves
    (one for each velocity component).  These solves will look like the
    diffusion operation, and will update the provisional velocity field.</li>

<li>Switch to a variable density system.  This will require adding a 
    mass continuity equation that is advected and switching the projections
    to a variable-coeffient form (since &rho; now enters).</li>

</ul>


<p><h2>&lowast; Going further</h2>

<p>The incompressible algorithm presented here is a simplified version
of the projection methods used in
the <a href="http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/Maestro">Maestro low Mach
number hydrodynamics code</a>.  Maestro can do variable-density
incompressible, anelastic, and low Mach number stratified flows in
stellar (and terrestrial) environments in close hydrostatic
equilibrium.  You can get a copy of Maestro on
the <a href="http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/Maestro/download/">Maestro
