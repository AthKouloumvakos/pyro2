-- cmp method in both grid and ccData2d
  
   then we can do a comparison by simply testing whether
   myd1 == myd2


-- how do we handle corner BCs?

   for reflect-odd all around, it doesn't look right

   what about 2 different BCs meeting at a corner -- who wins?


-- ii = numpy.arange(10)
   a = numpy.arange(40)
>>> print a[ii]
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
>>> print a[ii+1]
[ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10]
