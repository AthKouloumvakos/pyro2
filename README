I. Getting Started

  -- make sure you have numpy, f2py, and matplotlib installed on your
     machine
   
     (on a Fedora box, do: yum install numpy numpy-f2py
     python-matplotlib)

  -- set the PYTHONPATH environment to point to the pyro2/ directory
     in your .bashrc (or .tcshrc, depending on which shell you use)

  -- build the Fortran source.  In pyro2/, type:
  
      ./mk.sh

  -- run a quick test of the advection solver:

      ./pyro.py advection smooth inputs.smooth


II. Working With Data

  Some problems write a report at the end of the simulation specifying
  the analysis routines that can be used with their data.

  The plot.py script in the pyro2/ directory can be used to directly
  visualize the data from a .pyro output file.
