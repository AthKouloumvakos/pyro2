To get started:

 -- make sure you have numpy, f2py, and matplotlib installed on your machine
  
    (on a Fedora box, do: yum install numpy numpy-f2py python-matplotlib)

 -- set the PYTHONPATH environment to point to the pyro2/ directory in 
    your .bashrc (or .tcshrc, depending on which shell you use)

 -- build the Fortran source.  In pyro2/, type:
  
      ./mk.sh

 -- run a quick test of the advection solver:

      ./pyro.py advection smooth inputs.smooth
