===============

The original pyro code was written in 2003-4 to help understand this
methods for myself. This version "pyro2" was resurrected beginning in
2012 and rewritten for numpy and brought up to date.

You are free to use this code and notes in your classes. Please credit
Michael Zingale (SBU). Consider dropping me a line to let me know, as
I like to keep track of its usage.

pyro benefited from numerous useful discussions with Ann Almgren, John
Bell, and Andy Nonaka.
