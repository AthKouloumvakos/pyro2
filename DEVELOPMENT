This is a simple list of the improvements we wish to make to pyro.


coding:

  -- rewrite to adhere to python style guidelines

  -- docstrings should be added everywhere possible

  -- output library w/ colors
 
     WARNING()
     ERROR()

  -- is there a way to define a range like ii = [myg.ilo:myg.ihi+1]
     and then do something like ii+1 to get [myg.ilo+1:myg.ihi+2]?


solvers:

  -- Burgers equation (viscous and inviscid)


infrastructure:

  -- well-defined unit tests
