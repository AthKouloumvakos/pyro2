This is a simple list of the improvements we wish to make to pyro.


coding:

  -- make compatible with python 3.x

     * use __future__ to get the new print() to continue to work with python 2.6+

     * on Fedora, we need to install python3-numpy, python3-matplotlib

     * print -> print()

     * exec -> exec()

  -- rewrite to adhere to python style guidelines

  -- docstrings should be added everywhere possible

  -- is there a way to define a range like ii = [myg.ilo:myg.ihi+1]
     and then do something like ii+1 to get [myg.ilo+1:myg.ihi+2]?


new solvers:

  -- Burgers equation (viscous and inviscid)


infrastructure:

  -- well-defined unit tests
