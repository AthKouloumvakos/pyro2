This is a simple list of the improvements we wish to make to pyro.

ArrayIndexer:

  -- rewrite the ArrayIndexer class to simply subclass ndarray.  This is
     already speced out in mesh/experiments/test_subclass.py


new solvers:

  -- Burgers equation (viscous and inviscid)

  -- low Mach number hydro (both combustion and atmospheric)

  -- nodal MG solver?

  -- radiation hydro (gray FLD)


infrastructure:

  -- the MG solvers should check that the incoming coefficient arrays
     have the same # of ghost cells -- perhaps the coefficients should
     come in as their own ccdata2d object? or pass in a grid object
     like we do got mg.get_solution()
