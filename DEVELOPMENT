This is a simple list of the improvements we wish to make to pyro.


coding:

  -- rewrite to adhere to python style guidelines

  -- docstrings should be added everywhere possible

  -- output library w/ colors
 
     WARNING()
     ERROR()

  -- is there a way to define a range like ii = [myg.ilo:myg.ihi+1]
     and then do something like ii+1 to get [myg.ilo+1:myg.ihi+2]?

  -- make the solvers a class, with the data and grid as members of the 
     class.  This would allow for the timers to be refactored into an
     object that lives in the simulation object.

     Then we could do:

     sim = solver.Simulation(problem)

     ...

     sim.initialize()
     sim.evolve()
     ...

     This would make it more inline with how Castro is written.


new solvers:

  -- Burgers equation (viscous and inviscid)


infrastructure:

  -- well-defined unit tests
